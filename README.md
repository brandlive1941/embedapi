# Ustream Embed API

Enables sites using the [Ustream] embed iframe to build and adapt on the embed live player.

The Ustream Embed API provides basic methods to control the live stream or recorded video playback, and enables the user to access essential events of the live stream or the played video.

The Ustream Embed API requires [postMessage] DOM API, it won't work in browsers that does not support the postMessage API.
